Design your constraints: Create a file called constraints.txt – in this file, you will
specify,in plain English, how you implemented each of the 16 constraints in your database
schema. Specifically, for each constraint, you need to state:

1) How the constraint was implemented – did you choose to use a Key constraint
(using PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE), a Referential Integrity constraint, a CHECK
constraint, or a Trigger? (Note that in SQLite, Referential Integrity constraints are
often referred to as Foreign Key constraints.)
2) Which file(s) contain the constraint implementation – this will be useful for us when
we grade your Trigger constraints, if you have any.


Constraints for Users
1. No two users can share the same User ID.
2. All sellers and bidders must already exist as users.
--Constraints for Items--
3. No two items can share the same Item ID.
4. Every bid must correspond to an actual item.
5. The items for a given category must all exist.
6. An item cannot belong to a particular category more than once.
7. The end time for an auction must always be after its start time.
8. The Current_Price of an item must always match the Amount of the most recent bid for
that item.
--Constraints for Bidding--
9. A user may not bid on an item he or she is also selling.
10. No auction may have two bids at the exact same time.
11. No auction may have a bid before its start time or after its end time.
12. No user can make a bid of the same amount to the same item more than once.
13. In every auction, the Number_of_Bids attribute corresponds to the actual number of
bids for that particular item.
14. Any new bid for a particular item must have a higher amount than any of the previous
bids for that particular item.
--Constraints for Time--
15. All new bids must be placed at the time which matches the current time of your
AuctionBase system.
16. The current time of your AuctionBase system can only advance forward in time, not
backward in time
